        <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a legal agreement between you and Zoda Labs (“we”, “our”, or “us”) and govern your access to and use of our mobile application (the “App”).</p>

        <p>By using the App, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which describe how your information is collected, used, and protected. Continued use of the App signifies your acceptance of these Terms and consent to our data practices.</p>

        <p>If you are an individual, you represent that you are at least 14 years old and legally capable of entering into binding agreements. Users under 14 are not permitted to use the App or submit personal data.

        <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>We do not guarantee that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the App or its features will always meet your expectations or specific needs;</li>
          <li>the App will function without interruption, error, delay, or security issues;</li>
          <li>any insights or results generated by the App will be accurate or reliable;</li>
          <li>the quality or usefulness of any content or information will produce a specific outcome or benefit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The content within the App is not designed for everyone and may not suit all circumstances. It serves as a self-reflection and lifestyle tool intended to support personal balance and well-being. If any activities inspired by the App involve personal or emotional risk, you accept full responsibility for your choices, health, and safety.</p>

        <p>All materials provided are for informational and entertainment purposes only. The App is not a substitute for professional advice — medical, psychological, financial, or legal. Never delay or disregard seeking help from qualified professionals based on information found in the App.</p>

        <p>Your use of the App and reliance on its content are entirely voluntary and at your own risk. All decisions made based on the App’s information remain your sole responsibility.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Data and Content</h2>
        <p>When using the App, you may provide personal data, contact details, or other materials (“Your Content”). Your Content remains your property — these Terms do not grant ownership to us. However, you grant a limited license allowing us to store, process, and display it as needed for the App’s proper operation and improvement.</p>

        <p>By continuing to use the App, you consent to the processing and secure transfer of your data — including to trusted service providers and servers outside your country of residence — solely for the purposes of maintaining App functionality.</p>

        <p>Certain features, such as syncing, personalization, or backup, may temporarily access or process your Content. This access is strictly limited to providing the intended functionality.</p>

        <p>If you choose to share Your Content with others through the App, please do so thoughtfully. You are solely responsible for any consequences resulting from granting such access.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Accounts & Security</h2>
        <p>Some features may require account registration. You agree to provide accurate and current information and to maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials. You are fully responsible for activities that occur under your account.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, involve fraudulent behavior, or pose a security risk. Please report any unauthorized access immediately to our support team.</p>

        <p>All disclosures or interactions made within the App are at your own risk. We are not liable for any losses resulting from compromised passwords or unauthorized account access.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>The App may offer paid features or subscriptions managed through third-party platforms such as Apple. By completing a purchase, you authorize charges to your chosen payment method under the terms of those platforms.</p>

        <p>Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled in accordance with your platform’s rules. Deleting the App does not cancel active subscriptions. Refunds are provided only where required by law or explicitly stated in our policies.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for ensuring that your payment information is valid and authorized. We are not responsible for errors, declined payments, or issues arising from third-party systems.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the App or delete your account at any time. Access to paid content will remain active until your current billing period ends, as managed by your app store or payment provider.</p>

        <p>We may suspend or terminate access at our discretion if you violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent or harmful behavior, or misuse the App in a way that affects others.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The App and all related services are provided “as is” and “as available.” We make no warranties regarding accuracy, reliability, or uninterrupted operation. You use the App entirely at your own risk.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including data or financial loss.</li>
          <li>We do not guarantee that the App will be free from errors, viruses, or interruptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These limitations are necessary to allow us to offer the App affordably and fairly. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.</p>
